# Thing in Rings

AI-powered _Thing in Rings_ game refereeã€‚

You don't need to buy the game; just make some nounce cards, take a rope, and play instantly with your friends!

[access github pages to play](https://lxl66566.github.io/thing-in-rings-with-ai/)

- you need a openai-compatible api key to play (I suggest using gemini api key because it's free).
